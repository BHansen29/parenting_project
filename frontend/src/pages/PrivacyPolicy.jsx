        <h2>Our Sites and Children</h2>
        <p>
          The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and its rules (collectively,
          "COPPA") require us to inform parents and legal guardians about our practices for
          collecting, using, and disclosing personal information about children under the age of 13
          ("children"). It also requires us to obtain verifiable consent from a child's parent for
          certain collection, use, and disclosure of the child's personal information.
        </p>
        <p>This section notifies parents of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The types of information we may collect about children.</li>
          <li>How we use the information we collect.</li>
          <li>Our practices for disclosing that information, including information about third parties.</li>
          <li>
            Our practices for notifying and obtaining parents' consent when we collect personal
            information about children, including how a parent may revoke consent.
          </li>
          <li>All operators that collect or maintain information from children through this Tool.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This section only applies to information about children under the age of 13 and
          supplements the other provisions of this Policy. Children should not be accessing this
          Tool. It is not designed for children. We do not knowingly collect information directly
          from children. We only collect as much information about a child as is reasonably
          necessary, and you should not disclose more personal information than is reasonably
          necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Automatic Information Collection.</strong> We use technology to automatically
          collect information from our users, including information about children, when parents
          access and use the Tool.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Our Practices for Disclosing Children's Information.</strong> We do not share,
          sell, rent, or transfer children's personal information other than as described in this
          section. We may disclose children's personal information:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To third parties we use to support our Tool who are bound by contract to use the
            information only for a certain purpose and to keep it confidential.
          </li>
          <li>
            If we are required to do so by law or legal process, such as to follow any court order
            or subpoena or to respond to any government or regulatory request.
          </li>
          <li>
            If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property,
            or safety of Action for Children, our customers, or others — including to protect the
            safety of a child, protect the security of the Tool, or enable us to take precautions
            against liability.
          </li>
          <li>To law enforcement agencies or for an investigation related to public safety.</li>
          <li>
            If Action for Children is involved in a merger, divestiture, restructuring,
            reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of assets, we may transfer
            collected personal information to the buyer or other successor.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Accessing and Correcting Your Child's Personal Information.</strong> At any time,
          you may review the personal information we have about your child, require us to correct
          or delete it, and/or refuse to permit us from further collecting or using the child's
          information. To protect your privacy and security, we may require you to take certain
          steps or provide additional information to verify your identity before we provide any
          information or make changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our tool is not intended for use by children under 18. If we learn we have
          unintentionally collected personal data from a child under 18 without verification of
          parental consent, we will delete that information. If you are a parent or guardian and
          think we have information about your child, please contact{' '}
