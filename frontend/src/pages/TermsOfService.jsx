          ShareCare service with or without using automated documents, is not legal advice. Legal
          information is not the same as legal advice, which is the application of law to an
          individual's specific circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          The information on this Tool is not a substitute for and does not replace the advice or

        <p>
          You should not and are not authorized to rely on this Tool as a source of legal advice.
          The use of this Tool does not create an attorney-client relationship between Action for

        </p>
        <p>
          The Tool provides automated document assembly based strictly on information and
          selections provided by the user. The Tool is a clerical processing aid and does not
          evaluate, audit, or guarantee that any generated parenting plan complies with the Ohio
          Revised Code, local court rules, or any other applicable statutory requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The User expressly acknowledges that the Tool does not perform any legal analysis of
          whether a proposed plan serves the "best interest of the child" as defined by Ohio law.
          It remains the sole responsibility of the user to ensure that any document generated
          through the Tool meets the specific legal standards and welfare requirements of their
          jurisdiction. The generated output should be reviewed by qualified legal counsel prior to
          filing or execution.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final document output from this tool is a draft, is not binding, and must still be
          approved by a Judge, Magistrate, or the Court.

          This Tool provides automated document assembly based strictly on the information you

        <p>
          Action for Children is not responsible for incomplete or inaccurate translations, nor is
          it liable for any damages or losses arising out of the user's use of Google Translate™
